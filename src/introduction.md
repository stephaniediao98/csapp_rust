# Introduction
This is a rewriting of Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (known as CS:APP) in Rust. CS:APP focuses mainly on the C programming language. While C is useful for low-level programming and is highly portable, it is also unsafe and not very approachable. Rust, on the other hand, implements thoughtful safety and reliability features and provides a friendly, elegant set of tools that we believe would be helpful for students to learn.

## Assumptions about the Reader's Background
We assume that you have programmed in some programming language before. We do not expect you to have any knowledge of the Rust programming language or computer systems. We will gradually introduce you to both.
